# Vehicle Signal Specification

The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) is an initiative by [COVESA](https://www.covesa.global/) to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals.
The source code and releases can be found in the [VSS github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
Some tools for parsing and converting VSS files can be found in the [VSS-tools github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools).
